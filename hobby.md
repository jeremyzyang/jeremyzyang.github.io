### personal

I enjoy playing and watching sports, especially tennis, basketball, soccer, and skiing (for the long New England winters). I try to play some competitive tennis in my spare time (NTRP 4.0-4.5). I'm a big fan of sports analytics and have been working on a side project using [tennis](/assets/files/tennis_poster.pdf) data.

I took a standup comedy class from Dan Crohn and have been writing some jokes since, look out for them in my talks. I like singing too, here's an excerpt of my covering of [Trace (軌跡)](/assets/files/179LincolnSt4.m4a) and [Apocalypse (世界末日)](/assets/files/sjmr.m4a) by [Jay Chou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou). And here's some awesome video games that I've been playing lately: [Bloodborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne), [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice) and [Nioh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nioh). These games are all very challenging and can be quite frustrating to play, but they are also massively satisfying when I beat them. It resembles the process of doing research. 

I also like reading and debating about literature, philosophy, and theology (particularly [Apologetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics) and [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism)). I lived in a church in South Korea and went on a mission trip to South Africa after college.
