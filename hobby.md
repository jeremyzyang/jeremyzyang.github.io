### personal

I enjoy playing and watching tennis, basketball, soccer, and skiing (for the long New England winters). I'm a big fan of sports analytics and have a side project studying performance under pressure with point-by-point [tennis](/assets/files/tennis_poster.pdf) data.

 I like singing too, here's an excerpt of my covering of [Trace (軌跡)](/assets/files/179LincolnSt4.m4a) and [Apocalypse (世界末日)](/assets/files/sjmr.m4a) by [Jay Chou (周杰倫)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou).-->

I like standup comedy and took a class from Dan Crohn. Here are some great video games that I have played: [Elden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring), [Bloodborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne), [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice), and [Nioh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nioh). They are all very challenging and can be quite frustrating to play, but it is also massively satisfying when I beat them. It resembles the process of doing research. 

I also like reading literature, philosophy, and theology (particularly [Apologetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics), [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism) and [John Piper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Piper_(theologian))'s work). I lived in a church in South Korea and went on a mission trip to South Africa after college. I attend the Aletheia church in Cambridge.
