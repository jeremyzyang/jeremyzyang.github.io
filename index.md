I’m somewhat a convex combination of an economist and data scientist with the weight varying between 0 and 1 depending on the problem. 

My current research focuses on optimizing managerial decisions by developing algorithmic products that turn unstructured data into actionable insights. The algorithmic solutions we propose are typically motivated by basic microeconomic and behavioral principles and implemented with the state-of-the-art techniques in causal inference (both experimental and observational) and machine learning (e.g., computer vision, reinforcement learning). I’m also interested in understanding consumer behaviors more broadly and how they interact with these algorithmic products.

<!--My current research combines tools in econometrics, machine learning and leverages unstructured data (e.g., video, text, map and network) to optimize marketing decisions and answer questions of general interest in social sciences. I’m also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic psychological and neurological principles.
I have two lines of research on learning to design and deliver interventions. On the design side, I work on content strategy in creator economy. On the delivery side, I work on targeting policies. 
One stream of my current work focuses on combining machine learning and adaptive experimentation to personalize marketing interventions. Another one centers on extracting insights from unstructured data such as video (images, audios and text), map and network in observational studies. I'm also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic economic and psychological principles.

I'm fortuante to have my training supervised by [Juanjuan Zhang](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/juanjuan-zhang), [Sinan Aral](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/sinan-kayhan-aral) (co-chairs), and [Dean Eckles](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/dean-eckles). Yes, pun intended. Outside of MIT, I'm working with [Vishal Singh](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/vsingh/index.html) (NYU Stern School of Business). I'm also affiliated with the [Initiative on the Digital Economy](http://ide.mit.edu), [Social Analytics Lab](https://www.sinanaral.io/research/lab), [Behavioral Research Lab](https://brl.mit.edu), and the [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org/).

Prior to MIT, I studied economics, management, and statistics at the University of International Business and Economics and New York University. I've also worked in consulting as a business analyst.
