I’m a convex combination of an economist and data scientist. 

I develop data products for advertising, targeting, and pricing decisions in my research. These algorithms are typically guided by basic economic or behavioral principles and implemented with techniques in machine learning and causal inference. I’m also broadly interested in the creator economy and web3.

I received my PhD in management from the <a href="http://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. I'm also affiliated with the Harvard [Digital, Data, and Design (D^3) Institute](https://d3.harvard.edu/), the [Data Science Initiative](https://datascience.harvard.edu/), the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/), and the MIT [Initiative on the Digital Economy](http://ide.mit.edu).

I was fortunate to be supervised by [Juanjuan Zhang](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/juanjuan-zhang), [Sinan Aral](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/sinan-kayhan-aral) (co-chairs), and [Dean Eckles](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/dean-eckles). 
My current research combines tools in econometrics, machine learning and leverages unstructured data (e.g., video, text, map and network) to optimize marketing decisions and answer questions of general interest in social sciences. I’m also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic psychological and neurological principles.
I have two lines of research on learning to design and deliver interventions. On the design side, I work on content strategy in creator economy. On the delivery side, I work on targeting policies. 
One stream of my current work focuses on combining machine learning and adaptive experimentation to personalize marketing interventions. Another one centers on extracting insights from unstructured data such as video (images, audios and text), map and network in observational studies. I'm also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic economic and psychological principles. 
(e.g., video, text, map and network)
understanding consumer behaviors more broadly and how they interact with these algorithmic products. My recent work studies topics in 
My current research focuses on optimizing managerial decisions such as advertising, pricing and targeting by developing algorithmic products that turn big unstructured data into actionable insights.

Prior to MIT, I studied economics, management, and statistics at the University of International Business and Economics and New York University. I've also worked in consulting as a business analyst after college.
