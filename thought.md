### thoughts

Just some random thoughts on what I've been reading and thinking.

<ins>On knowing and doing</ins>

As kids we tend to do a bunch of random and stupid stuff just to try things out, just like when we are running a randomized experiment where doing precedes and causes learning. But as we grow we tend to have a strong prior on many things so the value of experimentation decreases, we do what we think is the best, where knowing precedes doing. I really like what [Celeste Kidd](https://www.kiddlab.com/) said in her NeurIPS 2019 talk on ["how to know"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvebjL48f-w): "It is what you think you know that determines your curiosity, not what you actually don't know, if you think you know the answer, you are not curious to check it so you don't, and you get stuck with the wrong answer. People don't have a good model of their own uncertainty." Hope we stay ignorant and curious.

<ins>On the science and engineering approach to managerial research</ins>

I subscribe to both the science and engineering view to managerial research. The science view studies “what is” and the “why” questions where we want to make conceptual breakthroughs by discovering and explaining interesting phenomena. The engineering view studies “what works” and the “how” questions where we want to solve important practical problems in a novel way. I find both type of work enjoyable and valuable.

<ins>On chasing the noise</ins>

Noise is the signal that we don't yet understand. Outcome variables with big variance usually have interesting stories behind them, especially the ones that remain highly variable after controlling for what we think, a priori, would explain them. Let's go chase the noise.

<!-- <ins>On the "science" and "engineering" type of research in business schools</ins>
Broadly speaking, I think there are two main flavors in the type of research conducted in business schools. I call them the "science" and "engineering" type. The "science" type solves intellectual puzzles, the purpose is to understand and explain. The "engineering" type provides solution to practical problems and can be implemented to show a real business impact. A good "science" type of research doesn't need to have a direct application, similarly, a good "engineering" type of research may not have a conceptual breakthrough. 
<ins>On my frustration with English dictionaries</ins>
They do two things that frustrate me. They either explain a world I don't know with another word that I don't know, or even worse, they explain a word with itself. I didn't know it is possible to bootstrap in languages? I was looking up the word _vexatious_ on Webster dictionary the other day and it says _causing vexation_, still don't know what it means. Then I search for _vexation_ it says _the quality or state of being vexed_. Really? I felt annoyed and still don't know what vexed means till this day. -->
